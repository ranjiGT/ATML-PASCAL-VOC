# `Object detection using SSL Classification`
Semi-Supervised Learning on image classification semester project.

## `Preamble` :scroll:
The Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision has conducted a benchmark PASCAL Visual Object Challenge (VOC) evaluating performance on object class recognition (from 2005-2012, now finished). For our task, we examine the 2007 dataset which consists of several types of random images collected in January 2007 from _Flickr_. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout.

Our goal from this challenge is to perform \textbf{image classification} from several visual object classes in realistic scenes (i.e. not pre-segmented objects). And so, we will be using certain Semi-Supervised Learning approaches where we have both labeled and unlabeled sets to check if we get superior results as opposed to supervised techniques.

Mandatory features

- MPEG-7 Color Layout Descriptor
